We present a framework for hedging a portfolio of derivatives in the presence of market frictions such as transaction costs, liquidity constraints or risk limits using modern deep reinforcement
machine learning methods. We discuss how standard reinforcement learning methods can be applied
to non-linear reward structures, i.e. in our case convex risk measures. As a general contribution to the use of deep learning for stochastic processes, we also show in Section 4 that the
set of constrained trading strategies used by our algorithm is large enough to ϵ-approximate any
optimal solution. Our algorithm can be implemented efﬁciently even in high-dimensional situations using modern machine learning tools. Its structure does not depend on speciﬁc market
dynamics, and generalizes across hedging instruments including the use of liquid derivatives. Its
computational performance is largely invariant in the size of the portfolio as it depends mainly
on the number of hedging instruments available. We illustrate our approach by an experiment
on the S&P500 index and by showing the effect on hedging under transaction costs in a synthetic market driven by the Heston model, where we outperform the standard ‘complete-market’
solution.

The goal of this section is to illustrate the power of
the methodology by numerically calculating the indifference
price (3) in a multi-asset market with transaction costs.
So far, this has been regarded a highly challenging problem,
see e.g. the introduction of Kallsen and Muhle-Karbe (2015).
For example, calculating the exponential utility indifference
price for a call option in a Black–Scholes model involves solving a multidimensional non-linear free boundary problem, see
e.g. Hodges and Neuberger (1989) and Davis et al. (1993).
Motivated by this Whalley and Wilmott (1997) have studied
asymptotically optimal strategies and price asymptotics for
small proportional transaction costs, i.e. for

can be trained using state-of-the-art machine learning optimization techniques in the spirit of reinforcement learning.
While in a frictionless market one would aim e.g. at minimizing the squared loss of the terminal hedging error, here
the optimality criterion is speciﬁed by a convex risk measure,
such as, for example, the average value at risk (expected shortfall). This framework allows to naturally incorporate market
frictions as e.g. transaction costs and liquidity restrictions.

## Figures

![Figure 1: Figure 1. Visualization of the structure of the network strategy δθ at tk. Input variables to δθ k are the current values of I (green nodes on the left) and the previous holdings in the hedging instruments (red nodes on the left). The network passes these through two hidden layers (blue nodes in the middle) and returns the current hedging position δθ k (red nodes on the right). The latter is then used as an input to δθ k+1, the strategy at tk+1.](assets/fig_001.png)

![Figure 2: Figure 2. Comparison of model hedge and deep hedge associated to the 50%-expected shortfall criterion. The ﬁgure shows a histogram of the terminal hedging error q −Z + (δ · S)T evaluated on the test data, for both δ = δH (model hedge) and δ = δθ (neural network hedge). The latter was optimized with α = 0.5 in (28).](assets/fig_002.png)

![Figure 3: Figure 5. Comparison of deep hedging strategies with recur- rent structure to those with a simpler network structure in the presence of proportional transaction costs ((34) with ε = 0.01). The ﬁgure shows a histogram of the terminal hedging error pθ 0 −Z + (δθ · S)T −CT(δθ) evaluated on the test data, for both δθ k = Fθk(Ik, δθ k−1) (recurrent) and δθ k = Fθk(Ik) (simpler). Both strategies were optimized with α = 0.99 in (28).](assets/fig_003.png)

![Figure 4: Figure 8. Comparison of holdings in stock for model hedge and 95%-CVar neural network hedge at k = 15 days when hedging a call spread. The ﬁgure shows the ﬁrst component of both δH k (model delta) and δθ k (network delta) as well as their difference plotted as a function of Ik = (Sk, Vk), evaluated on a grid containing [95, 103] × [0.3, 0.13]. The neural network hedge has the simpler structure δθ k = Fθk(Ik) and was optimized using α = 0.95 in (28).](assets/fig_004.png)

![Figure 5: Figure 10. Black–Scholes model price asymptotics for proportional transaction costs. The ﬁgure shows the pairs (log(εi), log(pεi −p0)) (in red) and the closest (in squared distance) line with slope 2/3 (in blue), where pεi is the neural network approximation to the exponential utility indifference price in a Black–Scholes model with proportional transaction costs (34) of size εi = 2−i+5, i = 1, . . . , 5.](assets/fig_005.png)

![Figure 6: Figure 12. Comparison of (daily recalibrated) Black–Scholes model and deep hedge centered at the Black–Scholes price. The ﬁgure shows a histogram of the terminal hedging error q −Z + (δ · S)T evaluated on the simulated test data.](assets/fig_006.png)
