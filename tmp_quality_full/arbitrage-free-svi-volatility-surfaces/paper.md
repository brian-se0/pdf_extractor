In this article, we show how to calibrate the widely used SVI parameterization of the implied volatility
smile in such a way as to guarantee the absence of static arbitrage. In particular, we exhibit a large class
of arbitrage-free SVI volatility surfaces with a simple closed-form representation. We demonstrate
the high quality of typical SVI ﬁts with a numerical example using recent SPX options data.
